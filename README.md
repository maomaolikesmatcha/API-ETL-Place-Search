This project combines and practices topics that I have learned in previous two weeks in the boootcamp:
- APIs
- Databases (SQL)
- Pandas
- Processing special data types in Python

I worked with these APIs:
1. [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/places) 
2. [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)

The main goal of this project is to build the database of restaurants, bars and various points of interest (POIs) in the area of your choice and find out which API has better coverage in the selected area.
